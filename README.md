# AES-128_Encrypt
C code for AES128 encrypt - Runs on ATMEL SAML21 XPro board

# Hardware
The Atmel Studio project provided requires Atmel SAML21 Xplained Pro. The code can be easily run on any other platform, just use the aes .h and .c files.

## Understanding AES Algorithm
AES128 code in this project was made for the sole purpose of understanding the algorithm. This code is written so that you can understand what happens in AES algorithm, this code should not be used in production.
